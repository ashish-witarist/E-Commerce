Here we write the code for backend.

********* Installation *********
1. Create a package.json file by "npm init" command.
2. Install express by using "npm i express" command.
3. Install mongoose by using "npm i mongoose" command.


********** What Works have been done in backend *********
1. Create a server.
2. Create the router and defines all the route.
3. Define the controllers for all the route.
4. Connect to database.
5. Define the model (collection name, schema)
6. create the json file 
7. Insert json file in collection which is created by using model 
8. when we hit the route then display the json data as response . this is done by controllers

********** ENV File *****************
It is used to hide private data
1. Install env by "npm i dotenv"
2. create a file by name ".env"
3. Put private data as variable like URL = "something"
4. To get data in file we have to require by "require("dotenv").config();"
5. used as "process.env.envVariableName"


Note : JSON file and env File do not need to export. it is only export 
Note : In express, only we require for import like as " const  A = require("path") " and module.exports for export like as "module.exports = {}/moduleName"
Note : But in react we import like as " import ComponentName from "../componentName" " and export like export default ComponentName
Note : For sending data from backend to frontend we use cors. Firstly we have to require cors and then use the cors
const cors = require("cors");//require the cors
app.use(cors());//use the cors

******* POST Data ********
1. Create an action on a button. When event is performed on button then api with post method with data will called
2. Create a route for api with post method will be called with a function.
3. This function save data in databse 
4. We have to use two things
    --> app.use(express.json())
    --> app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}))
